Internet Relay Chat
-------------------
IRC chat API. Can connect to IRC, read, and write. Works but still
a rough prototype.

See the [irc-chat.scm](../../../examples/irc-chat.scm) demo.

Design issues
-------------
IRC offers a non-trivial environment with which one can interact in
several ways, and offers several different kinds of stimulus and
several interaction modes: there are many channels one could join,
many users one could talk to, publicly (on a channel) or privately.
